3D Drawing Robot for 1:1 Scale Designs
Project Description
This project provides the C++ control software for an autonomous 3D drawing robot designed to create life-sized (1:1 scale) designs of houses, objects, or other structures directly onto a surface. The robot is equipped with a specialized 3D pencil mechanism to extrude drawing material and a unique four-wheel drive system for precise movement.

The robot's mobility system comprises four wheels: two of which are driven by stepper motors for precise control over movement and direction, and the other two are free-moving wheels that provide stability and allow for smooth turns. This combination ensures both accuracy in drawing and agility in navigation across the drawing surface.

Features
1:1 Scale Drawing: Capable of executing designs at actual size.

Precise Movement: Utilizes stepper motors for accurate positioning and path following.

3D Pencil Integration: Controls a 3D drawing mechanism (e.g., a modified 3D pen or custom extruder) to lay down material.

Modular Design: C++ code structure allows for easy adaptation to different hardware configurations.

Basic Navigation: Handles forward, backward, and turning movements.

Hardware Requirements
To run this code, you will need the following hardware components:

Microcontroller: An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Mega, ESP32) or similar microcontroller capable of handling multiple motor drivers and inputs/outputs.

Stepper Motors (x2): NEMA 17 or similar, suitable for driving the robot's wheels with high precision.

Stepper Motor Drivers (x2): A4988, DRV8825, or similar, compatible with your stepper motors.

Free-Moving Wheels (x2): Omni-wheels or caster wheels for stable, unpowered movement.

Robot Chassis/Frame: A sturdy frame to mount all components.

3D Pencil/Extrusion Mechanism: A device capable of extruding drawing material (e.g., plastic filament, paint). This might involve:

A modified off-the-shelf 3D printing pen.

A custom-built extruder with a small motor and heating element.

Power Supply: Appropriate power supply for the microcontroller, stepper motors, and 3D pencil mechanism.

Wiring: Jumper wires, breadboard (for prototyping), and connecting cables.

Optional Sensors: (e.g., IMU for orientation, encoders for finer motor control, limit switches for pencil height).

Software Requirements
Arduino IDE: For compiling and uploading the C++ code to your microcontroller.

Required Libraries:

AccelStepper.h (or similar for stepper motor control)

SoftwareSerial.h (if communicating with external modules like a 3D pencil via serial)

Other specific libraries depending on your 3D pencil mechanism or additional sensors.

Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-drawing-robot.git
cd 3d-drawing-robot

(Replace your-username/3d-drawing-robot with the actual repository path if it's hosted online).

Open in Arduino IDE:

Open the .ino file (e.g., main.ino or robot_controller.ino) in the Arduino IDE.

Install Libraries:

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries... in the Arduino IDE.

Search for and install AccelStepper (and any other necessary libraries mentioned above).

Configure Pin Assignments:

Open the main .ino file.

Locate the section where motor driver pins, 3D pencil control pins, and any sensor pins are defined.

Crucially, adjust these pin numbers to match the actual connections on your microcontroller.

// Example pin definitions (adjust these to your hardware)
#define STEPPER1_STEP_PIN   2
#define STEPPER1_DIR_PIN    3
#define STEPPER2_STEP_PIN   4
#define STEPPER2_DIR_PIN    5

// 3D Pencil control pins (adjust based on your mechanism)
#define PENCIL_EXTRUDE_PIN  6
#define PENCIL_HEAT_PIN     7 // If applicable

Connect Hardware:

Wire up your stepper motors, drivers, and 3D pencil mechanism to the microcontroller according to your adjusted pin assignments.

Ensure all components are properly powered.

Upload Code:

Select your board (Tools > Board > Arduino Uno/Mega/ESP32 Dev Module, etc.).

Select the correct port (Tools > Port).

Click the "Upload" button to compile and upload the code to your microcontroller.

Usage
The robot's operation will typically involve feeding it a sequence of commands or a pre-defined path representing your 3D design.

Design Input:

The robot expects a series of movement commands. These can be:

Hardcoded paths within the C++ sketch.

Read from a serial input (e.g., Serial.read()) where a computer sends G-code like commands or simple movement instructions.

Loaded from an SD card module (if integrated).

You will need to define a mapping from your design coordinates (e.g., from CAD software) to the robot's motor steps.

Calibration:

Motor Steps per Unit: Determine the number of stepper motor steps required for the robot to move a specific distance (e.g., 1 cm or 1 inch). This is crucial for 1:1 scale accuracy.

Pencil Calibration: Calibrate the 3D pencil's extrusion rate and retraction to ensure smooth, consistent material flow and prevent stringing or blobs.

Home Position: Define a starting or "home" position for the robot and ensure it can reliably return to it.

Start Drawing:

Once the design is loaded and calibration is complete, activate the robot.

Monitor its progress and intervene if necessary. You might implement pause/resume functionality via serial commands or physical buttons.

Code Structure (Conceptual)
The C++ code is likely structured with the following key components:

setup() function: Initializes serial communication, motor drivers, and the 3D pencil.

loop() function: The main control loop that reads design commands, calculates motor movements, and controls the 3D pencil.

Motor Control: Functions or classes (e.g., AccelStepper instances) to control the stepper motors' speed, direction, and step count.

Pencil Control: Functions to start/stop extrusion, control extrusion rate, and manage any heating elements.

Path Planning/Interpretation: Logic to convert design data into actionable robot movements.
